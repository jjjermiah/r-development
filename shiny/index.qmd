# Shiny Apps

This section is dedicated to interactive web applications built with Shiny, R's 
powerful web framework for creating data-driven apps and dashboards.

## Key Topics

- **UI fundamentals:** Building effective user interfaces with Shiny
- **Reactivity:** Understanding Shiny's reactive programming model
- **Performance:** Optimizing Shiny apps for speed and scalability
- **Modules:** Creating reusable components with Shiny modules
- **JavaScript integration:** Extending Shiny with custom JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Publishing apps to shinyapps.io, Shiny Server, and RStudio Connect
- **Authentication:** Implementing user authentication in Shiny apps
