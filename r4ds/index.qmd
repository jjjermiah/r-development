# R for Data Science

This section focuses on modern data science workflows in R using the tidyverse 
collection of packages. Based on the [R for Data Science (2nd Edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) 
book by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.

## Key Topics

- **Data transformation:** Using dplyr for manipulating tabular data
- **Data visualization:** Creating effective graphics with ggplot2
- **Data import:** Reading various file formats into R
- **Tidy data:** Structuring data effectively with tidyr
- **Exploratory data analysis:** Iterative process of visualization and transformation
- **Communication:** Sharing results through reports, dashboards, and visualizations

## Resources

- [R for Data Science, 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) - Modern R workflows 
  using tidyverse
- [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) - 
  Introduction from Roger Peng
- [ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/) - Statistical inference via data science
- [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) - 
  Learning R through building games

## Practice Projects

I'll be adding my practice projects and code examples in this section as I work 
through the book.

## Learning Outcomes

After working through this section, I should be able to:

- Transform and manipulate tabular data efficiently using dplyr
- Create effective data visualizations with ggplot2
- Import data from various file formats into R
- Structure data properly using tidy data principles
- Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis
- Communicate findings through reports and visualizations
- Apply data wrangling workflows to real-world datasets
- Build reproducible data analysis pipelines
