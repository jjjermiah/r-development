# R Package Development

This section covers the process of creating, documenting, testing, and sharing R 
packages. Based primarily on [R Packages (2nd Edition)](https://r-pkgs.org/) by 
Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan.

## Key Topics

- **Package structure:** Understanding the fundamental components of R packages
- **Documentation:** Using roxygen2 for function documentation and vignettes
- **Testing:** Implementing unit tests with testthat
- **Dependencies:** Managing package dependencies efficiently
- **CRAN submission:** Preparing packages for CRAN submission
- **GitHub integration:** Using GitHub for version control and collaboration
- **Continuous integration:** Setting up CI/CD workflows for R packages

## Resources

- [R Packages, 2nd Edition](https://r-pkgs.org/) - How to write and maintain R 
  packages
- [Tidyverse Design Guide](https://design.tidyverse.org/) - Philosophy and 
  patterns for extensibility
- [rOpenSci Packages Guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/) - Best practices for 
  scientific packages
- [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html) - 
  Official R manual for package authors

## My Package Projects

I'll document my package development journey here, including any packages I create.

## Learning Outcomes

After working through this section, I should be able to:

- Create well-structured R packages following best practices
- Write comprehensive function documentation using roxygen2
- Implement effective unit tests to ensure package reliability
- Manage package dependencies efficiently
- Prepare packages for submission to CRAN
- Use GitHub for package version control and collaboration
- Set up continuous integration workflows for R packages
- Create vignettes and other documentation to help users understand my packages
