# R in Production

This section explores strategies and best practices for using R in production 
environments, focusing on reproducibility, deployment, and scalability.

## Key Topics

- **Reproducible research:** Creating reproducible analyses and reports
- **Docker integration:** Containerizing R applications for consistent deployment
- **Performance optimization:** Scaling R for larger datasets and computations
- **Workflow automation:** Building data pipelines with targets and drake
- **Cloud deployment:** Running R in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **API development:** Creating APIs with plumber and FastAPI
- **Database integration:** Efficient database connections and queries

## Resources

- [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org/) - Best
  practices for production Shiny apps
- [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) - 
  Performance optimization
- [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) - Robust reproducible data pipelines
- [drake](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/) - Declarative pipeline toolkit
- [R Infrastructure](https://solutions.rstudio.com/r/infrastructure/) - RStudio's 
  guide to production infrastructure

## Production Case Studies

This section will include examples of deploying R code in production environments
and lessons learned.

## Learning Outcomes

After working through this section, I should be able to:

- Build reproducible R workflows that can run consistently across different environments
- Containerize R applications using Docker for deployment
- Optimize R code for better performance with large datasets
- Create automated data pipelines using targets or drake
- Deploy R applications to cloud environments
- Develop APIs that expose R functionality to other applications
- Establish efficient connections between R and various database systems
