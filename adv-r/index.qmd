# Advanced R

This section is dedicated to more advanced R programming concepts, based primarily 
on [Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). Here, I'll be 
exploring R's language internals, functional programming patterns, metaprogramming, 
and performance optimization.

## Key Topics

- **Language fundamentals:** Understanding R's unique object and environment systems
- **Functional programming:** Working with functions as first-class objects  
- **Object-oriented programming:** Exploring S3, S4, and R6 class systems
- **Metaprogramming:** Manipulating code as data with non-standard evaluation
- **Performance optimization:** Profiling, memory management, and code efficiency
- **Rcpp integration:** Extending R with C++ for performance-critical code

## Resources

- [Advanced R, 2nd Edition](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) - Hadley Wickham's 
  definitive guide
- [Advanced R Solutions](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/) - Companion with 
  exercise answers
- [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf) - Quirky 
  guide to common R traps

## Practice Work

- [Data Wrangling](01-wrangle.html) - Advanced data manipulation techniques

## Learning Outcomes

After working through this section, I should be able to:

- Understand R's unique object and environment systems
- Apply functional programming patterns to write cleaner, more maintainable code
- Implement and use different object-oriented programming systems in R (S3, S4, R6)
- Leverage metaprogramming techniques to solve advanced problems
- Profile and optimize R code for better performance
- Extend R with C++ using Rcpp for performance-critical operations
- Debug complex R code more effectively
