# Building Models in R

This section explores statistical modeling, machine learning, and inference 
techniques in R, covering both classical and modern approaches.

## Key Topics

- **Linear models:** Regression, ANOVA, and their extensions
- **Generalized linear models:** Logistic, Poisson regression, and more
- **Mixed effects models:** Analyzing hierarchical and longitudinal data
- **Bayesian analysis:** Using Stan, brms, and Bayesian workflows
- **Machine learning:** Classification, regression, clustering with tidymodels
- **Deep learning:** Neural networks with torch and keras
- **Model evaluation:** Cross-validation, metrics, and model comparison
- **Interpretable machine learning:** Understanding model predictions

## Model Gallery

I'll document my modeling projects here, including code examples, visualizations, 
and performance analyses.

## Learning Outcomes

After working through this section, I should be able to:

- Build and interpret various types of linear and generalized linear models
- Implement mixed effects models for hierarchical and longitudinal data
- Perform Bayesian analysis using Stan, brms, and related frameworks
- Apply machine learning techniques using the tidymodels ecosystem
- Implement neural networks and deep learning models in R
- Properly evaluate models using cross-validation and appropriate metrics
- Interpret model results to derive meaningful insights
- Select appropriate modeling approaches for different types of problems
